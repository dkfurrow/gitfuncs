git rm -r --cached file_to_remove.txt
then commit
file to remove is still in working tree, but 'untracked now'
can do the same for folder, recursively:
git rm -r --cached <folder>

**Merge Squash, to remove interim commits
https://docs.syntevo.com/SmartGit/HowTos/How-to-perform-squash-merges.html
In SmartGit, squash merges can be performed either from the main window or from the log window. In both cases, you first have to make sure you’ve checked out the branch onto which you want to apply the merge commit.

From the main window: In the main menu, select Branch|Merge. On the Merge dialog that shows up, first select the topmost commit (i.e. the newest) from the ones you want to want to squash merge into the current branch. Second, make sure the option Branch consisting of selected commit and its ancestors is selected. Then click on the Merge button.
From the log window: On the Commits view, right-click on the topmost commit from the ones to squash merge into the current branch. In the context menu, click on Merge. On the confirmation dialog that shows up, select the Merge to Working Tree option.
Regardless of whether you merged from the main window or the log window, your working tree is now in a merging state. If there are any conflicts, you’ll have to resolve them before you can proceed. Resolving conflicts is covered in another How-To: How to resolve conflicts.

If there weren’t any conflicts, or after all conflicts have been resolved, you can perform a commit (e.g. by selecting Local|Commit in the menu) to finish the squash merge operation. On the commit dialog, you’ll get to choose whether you want to create a regular Merge commit or a Simple commit (“squash”). Select the latter option and enter a commit message, then click on the Commit button.

Info
Don’t be puzzled if the resulting Git commands (reported in the Output view) do not mention a –squash option. Before committing, SmartGit simply deletes .git/MERGE_HEAD to convert the scheduled merge to a simple commit.

So the previous notes that there's a need to resolve conflicts, which will inevitably occur after the first publish:
https://docs.syntevo.com/SmartGit/HowTos/How-to-resolve-conflicts.html
How to resolve conflicts
A merge, rebase or cherry-pick may fail due to conflicting changes between two or more commits. If that happens, SmartGit will halt the operation and remain in a conflict state. The following screenshot shows what the Repositories view and Files view would look like in that state:
There are two ways to leave the conflict state: Resolving the conflicts and continuing the operation, or canceling the operation.
Resolving the conflicts: To resolve the conflicts, go through all conflicted files one by one and modify them as needed. SmartGit provides two features to facilitate this: First, there is a three-panel editor called the Conflict Solver. It can be opened for the currently selected file either through the menu entry Query|Conflict Solver in the main menu or through the file’s context menu. Second, you can instruct SmartGit to resolve the conflicts in a particular file by choosing a certain version of it. To do this, open the Resolve dialog, either through the main menu Local|Resolve, or through the file’s context menu, and choose the version of the file to keep.
Canceling the operation: You can cancel the operation that led to the conflict state by selecting the repository root in the Repositories view and invoking the Discard command. The latter can be done either by clicking on the Discard button on the main toolbar, or through the main menu: Local|Discard.

Here are the commands that github produces automatically when a repo is created.
git remote add origin git@github.com:dkfurrow/gitfuncs.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Adding remotes and tags:
from main menu, 'Remote' then 'add'
Created tag  from branch menu ('add tag and push' didn't seem to work very well), but push did
